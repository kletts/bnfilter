    abstract = {The Beveridge-Nelson decomposition based on autoregressive models produces
    estimates of the output gap that are strongly at odds with widely held beliefs about
    transitory movements in economic activity. This is due to parameter estimates implying a
    high signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the variance of trend shocks as a fraction of the
    overall forecast error variance. When we impose a lower signal-to-noise ratio, the
    resulting Beveridge-Nelson filter produces a more intuitive estimate of the output gap
    that is large in amplitude and highly persistent, and it typically increases in expansions
    and decreases in recessions. Notably, our approach is also reliable in the sense of being
    subject to smaller revisions and predicting future output growth and inflation better
    than other trend-cycle decompositions that impose a low signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {We introduce some refinements of the Beveridge-Nelson filter to help address possible distortions from large shocks. We then compare how the Beveridge-Nelson filter and other popular univariate trend-cycle decomposition methods perform given the extreme outliers associated with the Covid recession. Real-time estimates of the output gap based on the Hodrick-Prescott filter are highly unreliable in the years just prior to the pandemic, although the revised estimates during the pandemic are similar to those of the more reliable Beveridge-Nelson filter. The Hamilton filter suffers from base effects that produce a mechanical spike in the estimated output gap exactly two years after the onset of the pandemic, in line with the filter horizon. Given projected data with a simulated Covid-like shock, both the Hodrick-Prescott and Hamilton filters overstate the true reduction in the output gap and fail to capture the implied movements in trend output. The Hodrick-Prescott filter generates a spurious transitory boom just prior to the simulated shock, while the Hamilton filter produces another mechanical spike exactly two years after the simulated shock, as well as an ongoing divergence in forecasted values of the output gap away from zero. Only the Beveridge-Nelson filter correctly forecasts trend and cycle movements when faced with a Covid-like shock.}
